@article{Backscatter_Communication_and_RFID,
issn = {0090-6778},
abstract = {Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is intended to supplant legacy (optical) bar code scanning technology found in many logistic and retail applications. RFID is distinguished by inexpensive, low power and compact form factor tags, whose longevity and efficacy are predicated on using passive communication techniques and on-tag power harvesting. Such tags employ backscatter modulation, which does not require any active RF components. As a result, backscatter has become an attractive design choice for short-range communications in power constrained wireless sensor networking scenarios. The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, it aims to expose backscatter communication as an emerging topic to a communication systems-theoretic audience. Since backscatter modulation and on-tag power harvesting efficiency are coupled, it is necessary to re-examine notions of power and spectral efficiency from an energy-constraint perspective; this leads to novel coded modulation schemes for future RFID systems. Further, we investigate RFID MIMO systems where the channel fading encountered has different statistics than the classical Rayleigh fading model. In turn,the trade off between diversity order and spatial multiplexing gains are distinct from wide-area MIMO.},

abstract = {The Mifare Classic is the most widely used contactless smartcard on the market.The stream cipher CRYPTO1 used by the Classic has recently been reverse engineered and serious attacks have been proposed. The most serious of them retrieves a secret key in under a second. In order to clone a card, previously proposed attacks require that the adversary either has access to an eavesdropped communication session or executes a message-by-message man-in-the-middle attack between the victim and a legitimate reader. Although this is already disastrous from a cryptographic point of view, system integrators maintain that these attacks cannot be performed undetected.This paper proposes four attacks that can be executed by an adversary having only wireless access to just a card (and not to a legitimate reader). The most serious of them recovers a secret key in less than a second on ordinary hardware. Besides the cryptographic weaknesses, we exploit other weaknesses in the protocol stack. A vulnerability in the computation of parity bits allows an adversary to establish a side channel. Another vulnerability regarding nested authentications provides enough plaintext for a speedy known-plaintext attack.},

abstract = {In contrast to a block cipher, which regards messages as segmented into datablocks of a fixed length, a stream cipher has a fixed beginning, but it has no fixed end. A stream cipher encrypts a plaintext datastream of indefinite length, such as a long bitstream, which we can regard as an infinite datastream. An infinite stream of plaintext symbols is fed into an encryptor, using an encryption key of length m bits, and the infinite stream of ciphertext symbols leaves the encryptor. Later, the infinite stream of ciphertext symbols enters the decryptor, which uses the same key of length m bits, and the infinite stream of plaintext symbols leaves the decryptor. Stream ciphers have a long history, perhaps inspired by the one-time pad, and are in widespread use in many applications. A common form of stream cipher, called an additive stream cipher , converts the m -bit key into a semi-infinite binary stream, called a keystream . The encryptor adds the binary keystream modulo two to the binary datastream, bit by bit, to form the codestream. The decryptor adds the same keystream, modulo two, to the codestream, again bit by bit, and in this way recovers the datastream. Recall that a binary one-time pad consists of a semi-infinite random sequence of equiprobable bits that is known to both the encryptor and the decryptor. There is no constraint on the random binary sequence used as a one-time pad other than that it be maximally random.},

abstract="Symmetric encryption schemes are usually formalized so as to make the encryption operation a probabilistic or state-dependent function $\epsilon$ of the message M and the key K: the user supplies M and K and the encryption process does the rest, flipping coins or modifying internal state in order to produce a ciphertext C. Here we investigate an alternative syntax for an encryption scheme, where the encryption process $\epsilon$ is a deterministic function that surfaces an initialization vector (IV). The user supplies a message M, key K, and initialization vector N, getting back the (one and only) associated ciphertext {\$}C={\backslash}cal E{\_}K^N(M){\$}. We concentrate on the case where the IV is guaranteed to be a nonce---something that takes on a new value with every message one encrypts. We explore definitions, constructions, and properties for nonce-based encryption. Symmetric encryption with a surfaced IV more directly captures real-word constructions like CBC mode, and encryption schemes constructed to be secure under nonce-based security notions may be less prone to misuse.",
